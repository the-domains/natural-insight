> _**In our lives we face or come across situations that require us to make and take decisions, yet the question that comes first to our mind is broken down into sub-questions, What, How, Why, Where, When and Who, but not necessarily in the order listed.**_
> 
> **Logic states that everything happens for a reason, totally right and without any doubt!**
> 
> Take as an example Toothache, why do we get such symptom? how does it happen and when? To all of us the answer is clear and simple, probably the filling has fallen out, or the tooth has broken , or any other reason, yet the symptom is pain, so we go to the dentist, and all we care about is please let the pain go away.
> 
> Now that the pain is gone, we are happy, then two days pass, and we feel that pain all over again, so we go to the dentist asking about what happened,?how it happened? the dentist then may say "Well we need to find what really happened, and why"? now he or she want to go in the root cause to treat it permanently! this should have been done earlier, by finding out if a root canal was needed, instead of simply treating the symptom,**Ohhh! wait this may not be the solution, it can be the dentist error, so this why we need to perform a clear analysis of what has occurred.**
> 
> Now, we move over to the important part of the article, When we create businesses, we strive to build them based on visions, goals and strategies, but very few of us choose to miss one important factor "The People" in our strategy.
> 
> Certain business choose to omit matters that are crucial to their growth, instead they concentrate on the quick result, which sometimes happens to be negative, and not according to their expectations. At such point providing a quick fix is not the ideal solution, because we lack time or resources.
> 
> Their focus should be on why we have reached this level, through team-work and refer to the root cause coming up with a detailed structured logical analysis, identifying, verifying the actual cause, correcting and coming up with remedy that can act as a continuous preventive action without directly interfering with the process itself.
> 
> Cause & effect is simple, no one can question its logic, performing a deep-digging process as called "Root-Cause Analysis", will enable your unique situation, whether it is a business, individual and or any case that requires an RCA, so you can identify the underlying problem behind the symptom.
> 
> Many examples can be given on this, and I will list a brief on some as such:
> 
> * Car accidents a symptom described with a quick fix as reckless driving, think of it this is not true, the root cause can be many, and this why it has to be investigated.
> * Accounting department failure a symptom described with quick fix as people failure, possibly true, but why it can't be the system or the processes? again focusing on the Root-Cause Analysis is a must.
> * This could go on and on, and the list can go even further, surely there is no need to elaborate more because it is clear to all.
> 
> The morale of this, taking a business that has taken years to build, and people with years of experience that have become the root of it all, binding and spreading, nourishing the business as an entity to grow and become stronger, protecting & sustaining its livelihood.
> 
> Now the question that comes to mind, what happens when this business shows signs of weakness or failure, as a symptom we should ask why this has happened, how and why? The answer could be anything, so what we should do is look back at the roots, check if one has been damaged or harmed, do we treat it or pretend that it is okay, assuming the remaining roots will regenerate and revive the business?
> 
> The next question that comes to mind is what may happen if we intentionally damage this root by forgetting, yet knowing they're connected, and act as one, proceeding to our next step based on the given situation.
> 
> * Do we assign one individual or a team to identify the problem
> * Gather data and perform the needed analysis
> * Develop theories or rely on simple facts and findings
> * Acknowledge the findings, and revise the process or decisions
> * Monitor and assess the changes made
> * Benchmark the changes made, time is always against us because trial-error is not always in our favor.
> 
> Companies expecting business to flourish and succeed should always pay attention to its employees (its roots), consult and engage them in the decisions process, hear their opinions, you will be surprised of what they have to say, and yes it can be of benefit to all, now to achieve this you need to have a flexible working culture, if this does it exist, then you have built and created a culture of trust.

> _**Cause and effect analysis can't get past existing knowledge - must have either observed (or considered)****that the cause produced the effect in the past.**_

Remember a healthy root leads to a healthy prosperous tree.

**The last figure shows some important factors, we need to look at them carefully, see how they may exist in our environment, and only through listening and team-work (listen to the sound of majority it counts), apply the RCA process as the initial step toward creating the proper workplace, we all wish and hope for, eliminating the cause behind the symptom.**
