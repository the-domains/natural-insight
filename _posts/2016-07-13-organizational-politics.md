# **Organizational Politics**

I never thought the time will come and write about office or organizational politics, but it seems there's always an exception to have a change of mind.

Organizational politics can be described in two types:

**A**) Politics for the benefit of the organization, where the vision and goal are mutual, how to create the required growth and success?

**B**) Politics for the mere benefit of a single individual or a group of individuals, where their interest is only personal gain. access to either tangible assets, and intangible **Unethical behavior is a translation of individual and personal gain, and self integrity is a translation of organizational gain where everyone works for the same cause and goal, focusing on the interest of the business, rather than on one or a group of individuals.Unethical behavior is a translation of individual and personal gain, and self integrity is a translation of organizational gain where everyone works for the same cause and goal, focusing on the interest of the business, rather than on one or a group of individuals.**benefits that range from position and influential authority, clearly not to the benefit of the organization.

the latter part of office politics and by-all-means, is a destructive method unfortunately practiced by anyone who is after the one and only "Personal Gain & Growth", rather than organizational gain. Such practice can harm the structure of any organization, demolishing the foundation it was was built on, and leads to a corrupted environment.

Ethical behavior toward organizational politics can only be practiced if self integrity exists. Individual benefits and gains must be eliminated in every form possible, by creating the proper field and landscape, where organizational benefits and gains are the only acceptable method of practice, and it will be the only code of conduct tolerated.

Office politics if played for the organization gain, it is called a sound strategy, but when it used for personal interest it is called taking an advantage at the expense of the company you are working for, and the trust they have placed in you. This is called dirty and filthy office politics promoting own interest, damaging the work environment and the stakeholders interest in general.

To shed some further light on individual and group organizational politics and they way it is practiced, some call it "**I will scratch your back if you scratch mine**", by manipulating information, blaming others for something that is not their responsibility to begin with.**Yet above all biting chunks and weakening the structure.**

**Unethical behavior is a translation of individual and personal gain, and self integrity is a translation of organizational gain where everyone works for the same cause and goal, focusing on the interest of the business, rather than on one or a group of individuals.**

The culture being built should be an ethical culture filled with integrity, loyalty and respect, paving the road to proper behavioral practices, and leading to the sound organization you have set your vision on, and your aim as the ideal business.

Organizational politics shall and must be built on one vision "**One Alliance, One Goal**" solely for the benefit of the organization, and no one else. Once this is done everyone will gain.

A business that enforces organizational politics as one, monitors and eliminates the individual benefits in all of its forms and shapes, would have opened the path to create a culture of a cooperative atmosphere with one mutual goal in mind, growth and success.

**Office politics is also a combination of many decisive factors, naming a few**

A) One to differentiate between what is right and what is wrong?

B) Who has the respect of others?

C) Who can monitor and observe, and take the right proper decisions?

D) Who can communicate and engage others?

E) Who can inspire, lead and mentor others?

F) Who can build solid interpersonal relationships, based on trust, understanding and respect?

All of these decisive factors will enable you to take your business forward o the next level and to further achievements. **It is called commitment.**
